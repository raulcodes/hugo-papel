# oso <sup><sup><sub>v0.1</sub></sup></sup>

A small Hugo theme with color themes inspired by the popular iOS note-taking app, Bear.

Oso strives to be beautiful, fast, and accessible. All with optional, minimal Javascript.

## Lighthouse

[My personal blog](raulcodes.com) uses this theme and I aim to consistently score as highly as I can on Google's Lighthouse tool.
